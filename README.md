# Goals
- Application of different filters (Sobel, gray level, Canny, Prewitt ...) on images of size ranging from 1 MB to 4 MB.
- Comparison of performance (in terms of execution time) between the different methods used as well as the time spent on a CPU.

# Example: grayscale filter

# Input Image:

# Output Image

# Comparison between the different used methods

# Conclusion
on the graph above, we see that the execution time is much more interesting on the GPU.
